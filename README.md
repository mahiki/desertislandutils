# DESERTISLANDUTILS
Refactoring my convenience utility bash scripts into python for learning and profit.

* deploy: poetry -> pypi -> homebew
* github CI actions

## SCRIPTS
### toobigdatadoc
I like to keep text files in one directory system, with supporting data files and binary documents in parallel directories from the home folder: `toobig`, `toodata`, `toodoc`.
