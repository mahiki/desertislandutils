# TODO: migrate bash -> python

TODO: absolute path for non-repo, more likely to:

1. REL: move a folder within the local path
    * abs path will work, but the doc tree will look different vs. andromeda
2. ABS: have to rename links on new machine with diff root folder name
3. MAYBE: move folder, then script to move the bigdatadoc tree and relink

## TODO LIST
```bash
#   $HOME/repo/utility/prod

zhsrc: add()
hello-world
wn -> ../shell-dev/week-number.sh
dipgit
$HOME/bin/jl-utils/datagen -> ../utility-scripts/datagen.jl
args
```
