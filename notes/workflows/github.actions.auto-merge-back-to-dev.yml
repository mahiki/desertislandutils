# https://medium.com/@karlstad/create-a-github-actions-workflow-that-auto-merges-the-master-back-to-dev-branch-8b1ebe7009b3

# (ie in git flow arrangement, dev needs release updates)
# Need to have an up-to-date dev branch with the latest tags from the master branch available
# Example workflow file that will do this when a PR to the master branch is closed (and the PR is marked as “merged”).
